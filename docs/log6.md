## 2. Take-home Test
### Day 2: July 8, 2019 - Monday

**Project:** Take-home Test

<span class="center bold">Mock-up</span>

**Progress:**

I was given a take-home test by a company I've been interviewing with. The role is for Sr. Front-End Engineer.

The assignment was to take a comp and build a fully functional and responsive e-commerce page.

It needed to use a build system and will be reviewed for:

- organization
- readability of code
- pixel perfect recreation of the mockup
- end product results

The instructions for the assignment are here: [vickys-flowers/docs/INSTRUCTIONS.md](https://github.com/james-priest/vickys-flowers/blob/master/docs/INSTRUCTIONS.md).

## 1. JAMstack Discovered
### Day 1: June 29, 2019 - Saturday

**Project:** JAMstack Research

[![App](assets/images/r6d1-small.jpg)](assets/images/r6d1.jpg)<br>
<span class="center bold">Stack History</span>

**Progress:**

JAMstack is the newest stack in the evolution of development for the web. It represents a leap forward in in the following areas.

- Improved scaling
- Heightened security
- Accelerated load times
- Better developer experience:

I to does this by decoupling the CMS content (data) from the website (presentation & structure).

<span class="center bold">Stacks Compared</span>

This allows the website to be statically generated. It pulls in data through API calls. The static site can then be served by CDNs (Content Delivery Network) without the need for a server.
