## 8. The Coding Interview Bootcamp - Grider
### Day 8: July 17, 2019 - Wednesday

**Project:** Practice Whiteboarding Algorithms + Data Structures

[![App](assets/images/r6d8-small.jpg)](assets/images/r6d8.jpg)<br>
<span class="center bold"></span>

**Progress:**

Today I started a Udemy course called:

- [The Coding Interview Bootcamp: Algorithms + Data Structures](https://www.udemy.com/coding-interview-bootcamp-algorithms-and-data-structure) by Stephen Grider.

This is an awesome course that specifically prepares you to be whiteboarded.  Beyond that it also gives you tons of practice solving everyday algorithmic challenges.

Now that I've done a few interviews and technical assessments, I have a sense of what's really needed to nail the code challenges so that you are more likely to get that job offer.

This course does just that by focusing on the techniques necessary to problem solve on the spot. It also give you the tools to look at each problem as a set of steps that can be decomposed into manageable chunks.

## 7. Learn Teach Code Meetup
### Day 7: July 16, 2019 - Tuesday

**Project:** Networking

[![App](assets/images/r6d7-small.jpg)](assets/images/r6d7.jpg)<br>
<span class="center bold">Learn Teach Code Meetup</span>

**Progress:**

Today I went to my weekly Learn Teach Code Meetup ([https://learnteachcode.org/](https://learnteachcode.org/)).

This has been a great way to get out and network with other developers who want to exchange ideas, code together, get help, or discuss job hunting.  

Most folks in the group are training to level up or are in the process of trying to find a job.

It's tough because every job wants 2-3 years of [fill in the blank] experience. This makes it super tough to break into for anyone who's just mastering a new technology or skill.

On a related note, I met up with [VJ Hawkins](https://twitter.com/vjhawkins1), one of my [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23100DaysOfCode&src=tyah) Twitter fam. In fact, this was the first time I've had a chance to meet one of my fellow [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23100DaysOfCode&src=tyah) crew IRL.

Had a great time discussing the struggle of securing a tech job in this highly competitive space.

## 6. On-Site Technical Interview @ Honey
### Day 6: July 15, 2019 - Monday

**Project:** Technical Interview @ Honey

[![App](assets/images/r6d6-small.jpg)](assets/images/r6d6.jpg)<br>
<span class="center bold">Honey Headquarters</span>

**Progress:**

Today I had an amazing experience. I interviewed for 5 straight hours at a company called Honey. I was given a tour, learned about the company, and was whiteboarded thoroughly.

The technical skills assessments covered four distinct areas.

- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript ES6
- React.js & Frameworks
- Interactive Design

Each one took about an hour and was guided along by either one or two engineers.

A problem was presented in each area and the task was to do the following:

- Understand the problem by asking clarifying questions.
- Determine any edge case scenarios.
- Code a solution to solve the problem.

The one thing that became abundantly clear was that everyone at this company was really smart. The level of expertise and knowledge was exceptional which helped fuel my excitement at the prospect of working with these folks.

Beyond that, the company culture is one of diversity, inclusion, and a passion to provide savings to customers on a massive scale.

Now I wait to hear back and see if I made the cut and if there was a good fit.

Oh, and I got this cool swag bag!

## 5. Static Site Generators
### Day 5: July 13, 2019 - Saturday

**Project:** R & D

[![App](assets/images/r6d5-small.jpg)](assets/images/r6d5.jpg)<br>
<span class="center bold">Static Site Generators</span>

**Progress:**

I spent some time digging into the world of [Static Site Generators (SSGs)](https://www.staticgen.com/about).

SSGs are solutions built on top of the [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) . JAMStack is a new way of architecting sites that relies on JavaScript, APIs, & prerendered Markup served without webservers.

Instead these are served from CDNs, Git repositories, or Static Site Generator Hosting like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

> When we talk about “The Stack,” we no longer talk about operating systems, specific web servers, backend programming languages, or databases.
>
> The JAMstack is not about specific technologies. It’s a new way of building websites and apps that delivers better performance, higher security, lower cost of scaling, and a better developer experience.

Examples of SSGs are:

- Next.js
- Jekyll
- Hugo
- Gatsby
- React Static

They can easily be deployed to Netlify from a GitHub repo. In fact, it's even easier than that.  Netlify built a [1-click deploy](https://www.staticgen.com/) that creates a repo and deploys a static starter site in one shot.

## 4. React/Redux Skills Test
### Day 4: July 12, 2019 - Friday

**Project:** Technical Interview

[![App](assets/images/r6d4-small.jpg)](assets/images/r6d4.jpg)<br>
<span class="center bold">Redux actions</span>

**Progress:**

I took a few days to recreate the take-home test I was given and build it using React and Redux.

This was a good exercise in using a centralized state management solution a provided practice with the following:

- Action creators
- Reducers
- Async Redux with Redux Thunk
- Promises
- Async & Await

Also added spinners to indicate Async calls.

## 3. Technical Test Fail
### Day 3: July 10, 2019 - Wednesday

**Project:** Technical Interview

[![App](assets/images/r6d3-small.jpg)](assets/images/r6d3.jpg)<br>
<span class="center bold">Test Score</span>

**Progress:**

I took a timed technical test as part of the interview process for a job today. It covered:

- JavaScript
- React.js
- Node.js
- HTML/CSS/DOM

I'm pretty good at all these things but did horribly on this test. The frustrating part was that I over-thought each and every problem.

Watching the time tick down as I struggled to debug and work the problems in my editor didn't help either.

Once the test was done, I reviewed the problems. In most cases the solutions turned out to be so simple and straight-forward. These were things like missing parenthesis or out of order function calls.

The moral of the story is to breathe and look for the obvious issues first. I was thinking I had to refactor and utilize obscure language constructs, but this often wasn't the case.

Here are a couple samples...

## 2. Take-home Test
### Day 2: July 8, 2019 - Monday

**Project:** Technical Interview

[![App](assets/images/r6d2a-small.jpg)](assets/images/r6d2a.jpg)<br>
<span class="center bold">Mock-up</span>

**Progress:**

I was given a take-home test by a company I've been interviewing with. This was in lieu of a whiteboard session or live coding technical interview . The role is for Sr. Front-End Engineer.

The assignment was to take a comp and build a fully functional and responsive e-commerce page.

It needed to use a build system and was reviewed for:

- Organization
- Readability of code
- Pixel perfect recreation of the mockup
- End product results

The other elements it needed to have were:

- Drag and drop capability
- Dynamic update of shopping cart
- Randomized values in drop-down select inputs

The instructions for the assignment are here: [vickys-flowers/docs/INSTRUCTIONS.md](https://github.com/james-priest/vickys-flowers/blob/master/docs/INSTRUCTIONS.md).

## 1. JAMstack Discovered
### Day 1: June 29, 2019 - Saturday

**Project:** JAMstack Research

[![App](assets/images/r6d1-small.jpg)](assets/images/r6d1.jpg)<br>
<span class="center bold">Stack History</span>

**Progress:**

JAMstack is the newest stack in the evolution of development for the web. It represents a leap forward in in the following areas.

- Improved scaling
- Heightened security
- Accelerated load times
- Better developer experience:

I to does this by decoupling the CMS content (data) from the website (presentation & structure).

[![App](assets/images/r6d1a-small.jpg)](assets/images/r6d1a.jpg)<br>
<span class="center bold">Stacks Compared</span>

This allows the website to be statically generated. It pulls in data through API calls. The static site can then be served by CDNs (Content Delivery Network) without the need for a server.
