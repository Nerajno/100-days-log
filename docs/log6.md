## 3. Online Technical Test
### Day 3: July 10, 2019 - Wednesday

**Project:** Technical Interview

<span class="center bold">Test Score</span>

**Progress:**

I took a timed technical test as part of the interview process for a job today. It covered:

- JavaScript
- React.js
- Node.js
- HTML/CSS/DOM

I'm pretty good at all these things but did horribly on this test. The frustrating part was that I over-thought each and every problem.

Watching the time tick down as I struggled to debug and work the problems in my editor didn't help either.

Once the test was done, I reviewed the problems. In most cases the solutions turned out to be so simple and straight-forward. These were things like missing parenthesis or out of order function calls.

The moral of the story is to breathe and look for the obvious issues first. I was thinking I had to refactor and utilize obscure language constructs, but this often wasn't the case.

Here are a couple samples...

## 2. Take-home Test
### Day 2: July 8, 2019 - Monday

**Project:** Technical Interview

[![App](assets/images/r6d2a-small.jpg)](assets/images/r6d2a.jpg)<br>
<span class="center bold">Mock-up</span>

**Progress:**

I was given a take-home test by a company I've been interviewing with. This was in lieu of a whiteboard session or live coding technical interview . The role is for Sr. Front-End Engineer.

The assignment was to take a comp and build a fully functional and responsive e-commerce page.

It needed to use a build system and was reviewed for:

- Organization
- Readability of code
- Pixel perfect recreation of the mockup
- End product results

The other elements it needed to have were:

- Drag and drop capability
- Dynamic update of shopping cart
- Randomized values in drop-down select inputs

The instructions for the assignment are here: [vickys-flowers/docs/INSTRUCTIONS.md](https://github.com/james-priest/vickys-flowers/blob/master/docs/INSTRUCTIONS.md).

## 1. JAMstack Discovered
### Day 1: June 29, 2019 - Saturday

**Project:** JAMstack Research

[![App](assets/images/r6d1-small.jpg)](assets/images/r6d1.jpg)<br>
<span class="center bold">Stack History</span>

**Progress:**

JAMstack is the newest stack in the evolution of development for the web. It represents a leap forward in in the following areas.

- Improved scaling
- Heightened security
- Accelerated load times
- Better developer experience:

I to does this by decoupling the CMS content (data) from the website (presentation & structure).

[![App](assets/images/r6d1a-small.jpg)](assets/images/r6d1a.jpg)<br>
<span class="center bold">Stacks Compared</span>

This allows the website to be statically generated. It pulls in data through API calls. The static site can then be served by CDNs (Content Delivery Network) without the need for a server.
