## 32. React/Redux Polling App Semantic UI React
### Day 32: April 1, 2019 - Monday

**Project:** [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

[![App](https://james-priest.github.io/reactnd-project-would-you-rather/assets/images/wyr8-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/reactnd-project-would-you-rather/assets/images/wyr8.jpg)<br>
<span class="center bold">UI Test 2</span>

**Progress:** Continued React/Redux project for my React Nanodegree Program.

I started with the planning stage of evaluating different React UI Libraries for my UI Framework. I settled on [Sematic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/).

I has awesome docs with examples and code for every component. Each example is done with an embedded CodeSandbox instance so you can instantly tweak the code.

Here's the short list of features.

- jQuery Free
- Declarative API
- Augmentation
- Shorthand Props
- Sub Components
- Auto Controlled State

I created a couple UI test samples to play with the library and have found it to be very flexible

## 29. Twitter Redux App Done
### Day 29: March 29, 2019 - Friday

**Project:** [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

[![Redux](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rr80-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rr80.jpg)<br>
**Live Demo:** [Chirper - Redux Twitter@11-react-router](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/james-priest/reactnd-redux-twitter/tree/11-react-router) on CodeSandbox

**Progress:** Continued Udacity Redux lesson for my React Nanodegree Program.

Today I finished my "real-world" Twitter-like app. It employed the following.

- React
- Redux
- React Router
- Redux Thunk

Today's lesson involved implementing React Router across the views and hooking up the child components work with router.

Now that this exercise is done, I should have the required skills to complete my required 2nd React Nanodegree project. The suggested due date was last week so I hope I'm able to knock it out in the next 5-7 days.

## 28. Container Component
### Day 28: March 28, 2019 - Thursday

**Project:** [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

[![Redux](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rr77-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rr77.jpg)<br>
**Live Demo:** [Chirper - Redux Twitter@10-tweet-page](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/james-priest/reactnd-redux-twitter/tree/10-tweet-page) on CodeSandbox

**Progress:** Continued Udacity Redux lesson for my React Nanodegree Program.

Now that I have a few components such as Dashboard, Tweet, & AddTweet, I can begin to compose them in my TweetPage container component.

The Tweet Page displays

- The tweet that has been selected
- An input to reply to the selected tweet
- List of existing replies

Since the actions, action creators, and reducers already exist for my child components it was a matter of fine-tuning the children to work in different contexts.

## 27. Compose New Tweet
### Day 27: March 27, 2019 - Wednesday

**Project:** [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

[![Redux](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rr76-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rr76.jpg)<br>
**Live Demo:** [Chirper - Redux Twitter@9-new-tweet](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/james-priest/reactnd-redux-twitter/tree/9-new-tweet) on CodeSandbox

**Progress:** Continued Udacity Redux lesson for my React Nanodegree Program.

This next part of this Twitter-like Redux app consisted of building the following:

- NewTweet Component
- ADD_TWEET action and addTweet action creator
- Thunk `handleAddTweet` function for the async API call
- ADD_TWEET reducer to return updated Redux state
- Connect the action creators to the NewTweet component for Redux dispatch

## 26. Redux Dispatch Action
### Day 26: March 26, 2019 - Tuesday

**Project:** [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

[![Redux](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rr75-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rr75.jpg)<br>
**Live Demo:** [Chirper - Redux Twitter@8-like-tweet](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/james-priest/reactnd-redux-twitter/tree/8-like-tweet) on CodeSandbox

**Progress:** Continued Udacity Redux lesson for my React Nanodegree Program.

This part of the app consists the following:

- Adding a TOGGLE_TWEET action creator
- Building a thunk `handleToggleTweet` function for the async API call
- Creating a TOGGLE_TWEET reducer to return the updated state
- Connecting the action creators to our component for dispatch

## 25. React Redux Loading Bar
### Day 25: March 25, 2019 - Monday

**Project:** [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

[![Redux](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rr70-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rr70.jpg)<br>

**Live Demo:** [Chirper - Redux Twitter@7-loading](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/james-priest/reactnd-redux-twitter/tree/7-loading) on CodeSandbox

**Progress:** Continued Udacity Redux lesson for my React Nanodegree Program.

This part of the lesson involved using a prebuilt component called [react-redux-loading-bar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-redux-loading-bar) to provide a loading bar that works with Redux.

The component has three parts to it.

- actions creators: showLoading & hideLoading
- loading bar reducer
- loading bar component

The three pieces need to be implemented in order for everything to work properly.

You can read more in my notes: [Udacity React & Redux - 7.13 Loading Bar](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/course-notes/react-redux.html#712-tweet-component)

## 24. Tweet Component
### Day 24: March 24, 2019 - Sunday

**Project:** [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

[![Redux](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rr69-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rr69.jpg)<br>
**Live Demo:** [Chirper - Redux Twitter@6-tweet-ui](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/james-priest/reactnd-redux-twitter/tree/6-tweet-ui) on CodeSandbox

**Progress:** Continued Udacity Redux lesson for my React Nanodegree Program.

This next step involved bringing in various slices of the store into the Tweet component. This included

- authedUser
- tweets
- users

This data is then formatted before it's made available as props to our component.

```jsx
// Tweets.js
function mapStateToProps({ authedUser, users, tweets }, { id }) {
  const tweet = tweets[id];
  const parentTweet = tweet ? tweets[tweet.replyingTo] : null;

  return {
    authedUser,
    tweet: tweet
      ? formatTweet(tweet, users[tweet.author], authedUser, parentTweet)
      : null
  };
}
```

Once the component deconstructs the data elements, it renders out the information.

## 23. Dashboard Component
### Day 23: March 23, 2019 - Saturday

**Project:** [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

[![Redux](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rr65-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rr65.jpg)<br>
**Live Demo:** [Chirper - Redux Twitter@5-dashboard](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/james-priest/reactnd-redux-twitter/tree/5-dashboard) on CodeSandbox

**Progress:** Continued Udacity Redux lesson for my React Nanodegree Program.

The next set of steps involves rendering state data from my Redux store as React UI. Starting with the Dashboard component, I needed to pull in a list of TweetIds. I did this by

- Using react-redux `mapStateToProps`
- Destructuring the `tweets` slice of my state
- Extracting `tweetIds` and sorting in reverse chronological order

```js
function mapStateToProps({ tweets }) {
  return {
    tweetsIds: Object.keys(tweets).sort(
      (a, b) => tweets[b].timestamp - tweets[a].timestamp
    )
  };
}
```

I then mapped over this in my Dashboard component.

```jsx
class Dashboard extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const { tweetsIds } = this.props;
    return (
      <div>
        <h3 className="center">Your Timeline</h3>
        <ul className="dashboard-list">
          {tweetsIds.map(id => (
            <li key={id}>
              <div>TWEET ID: {id}</div>
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default connect(mapStateToProps)(Dashboard);
```

## 22. Populate Redux Store
### Day 22: March 22, 2019 - Friday

**Project:** [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

[![Redux](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rr67-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rr67.jpg)<br>

**Progress:** Continued Udacity Redux lesson for my React Nanodegree Program.

Now that I have my Redux action creators, reducers, and middleware in place it was time to do the following:

- Use the react-redux `connect()` method to hook Redux up to my App component. This turns App into a container component by providing access to the store and it's methods.
- Deconstruct the store's `dispatch` method inside of `componentDidMount()`.
- Dispatch my thunk action creator (`handleInitialData`) to populate the store.

```jsx
// App.js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { handleInitialData } from '../actions/shared';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';

class App extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    const { dispatch } = this.props;

    dispatch(handleInitialData());
  }
  render() {
    return <div>Starter Code</div>;
  }
}

export default connect()(App);
```

## 21. Actions, Reducers, & Middleware
### Day 21: March 21, 2019 - Thursday

**Project:** [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

<span class="center bold">The Store contains `tweets`, `users`, & `authedUsers` properties.</span>

**Progress:** Continued Udacity Redux lesson for my React Nanodegree Program.

I've now gotten into the coding portion my real-world Twitter-like Redux application.

I started with the actions and action creators. I then worked my way through the reducers. Next, I continued with the middleware.

I now have the following pieces hooked up and in place.

- Action Creators
- Thunk Action Creators (for async operations)
- Reducers
- Root Reducer (to combine store slices)
- Middleware (thunk & logger)

Nothing actually appears in the app yet because I haven't actually dispatched any actions.  That'll be next.

## 20. Planning Steps 3 & 4 Events & Store Data
### Day 20: March 20, 2019 - Wednesday

**Project:** [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

[![Redux](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rr57-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rr57.jpg)<br>
**Live Demo:** [Chirper - Redux Twitter-like App](https://tylermcginnis.com/projects/redux-twitter/)

**Progress:** Continued Udacity Redux lesson for my React Nanodegree Program.

This section of the course gets into building a real-world Twitter-like Redux application by first starting with the application design process.

The next two steps of the design process are:

- **Step 3** - Identify App Events
- **Step 4** - Determine Store Data

We identify app events by taking a look at what can happen in each component. Specifically, what actions the app or user is performing *on the data* in each component.

[![rr59](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rr59-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rr59.jpg)<br>
<span class="center bold">New tweet components</span>

Looking at this view we can determine the following events (actions) are needed.

- *get* the **authedUser** so the user can create a new tweet.
- *set* the **text** of the new tweet.

When determining what data should live in the store we can follow Dan Abramov's advice.

> *"Data should be moved to the store when that data or state matters globally or when it is mutated in complex ways."*

## 19. Planning Steps 1 & 2 Views & Components
### Day 19: March 19, 2019 - Tuesday

**Project:** [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

[![Redux](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rr53-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rr53.jpg)<br>
**Live Demo:** [Chirper - Redux Twitter-like App](https://tylermcginnis.com/projects/redux-twitter/)

**Progress:** Continued Udacity Redux lesson for my React Nanodegree Program.

This section of the course gets into building a real-world Twitter-like Redux application by first starting with the application design process.

The first two steps of the design process are:

- **Step 1** - Identify Views
- **Step 2** - Create Component Hierarchy

Identifying the views consists of drawing each page or screen of the app on a sheet of paper. This will help identify what information and data in required. In this case we already have a mockup we can use as a screenshot.

[![rr52](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rr52-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rr52.jpg)<br>
<span class="center bold">New tweet view</span>

Creating the component hierarchy consists of drawing boxes around every component on the page and organizing the hierarchy based on the nesting of these components.

## 18. Real World Redux
### Day 18: March 18, 2019 - Monday

**Project:** [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

[![Redux](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rr49-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rr49.jpg)<br>
**Live Demo:** [Chirper - Redux Twitter-like App](https://tylermcginnis.com/projects/redux-twitter/)

**Progress:** Continued Udacity Redux lesson for my React Nanodegree Program.

This section of the course gets into building a real-world Twitter-like Redux application by first starting with the application design process.

These are the steps we follow before writing a single line of code.

1. Identify What Each View Should Look Like
2. Break Each View Into a Hierarchy of Components
3. Determine What Events Happen in the App
4. Determine What Data Lives in the Store

This app will provide basic functionality like timeline, tweets, reply's, likes, etc. We'll use what we've learned so far to accomplish this including:

- Redux
- React
- React-Redux bindings
- Middleware (API call & thunks)

**Progress:** Continued Udacity Redux lesson for my React Nanodegree Program.

I spent the day reading through a handful of key articles that detailed how to best organize and manage code related to large-scale Redux applications.

This was very eye opening. It included the following topics.

- Normalizing data before use
- Storing data with an index and accessing it with selectors
- Keeping canonical data (data from the DB or API) separate from UI state data
- Splitting the store into sub-stores & using slice reducers
- Other best practices for connecting React components to Redux state

**Progress:** Continued Udacity Redux lesson for my React Nanodegree Program.

This lesson was showed how to organize and structure a React Redux app using the [Rails-style pattern](https://redux.js.org/faq/code-structure) folder structure.

This splits files according to function with these folders.

- actions
- constants
- reducers
- containers
- components

The exercise involved splitting all existing code for my Todo & Goals app according to this structure.

**Progress:** Continued Udacity Redux lesson for my React Nanodegree Program.

This lesson was about implementing the `react-redux` library to provide an efficient way to pass a Redux store to our React components.

This included

- Importing the `react-redux` library
- Wrapping `App` with Provider and passing in the store
- Using `connect()` to map state & dispatch to props and then passing in the component we want to connect the redux store to.

## 13. React Context API
### Day 13: March 13, 2019 - Wednesday

**Project:** [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

[![Redux](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rr48-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rr48.jpg)<br>
**Live Demo:** [Context API Todo Goals App](https://codesandbox.io/s/l5m5n58rx7?fontsize=14) on CodeSandbox

**Progress:** Continued Udacity Redux lesson for my React Nanodegree Program.

This lesson covered the use of React's Context API which gives deeply nested components access to props without having to pass them all the way down the hierarchy.

It uses:

- Declarative syntax
- `<Context.Provider>` to accept data which is to be passed to a consumer component
- `<Context.Consumer>` which accepts a child function that provides access to the data and returns JSX.

```jsx
// Provider
class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
  const name = 'Tyler';

  return (
    <Context.Provider value={name}>
      <Parent />
    </Context.Provider>
    );
  }
}

// Consumer
function Grandchild ({ name }) {
  return (
    <Context.Consumer>
      {(name) => (
        <div>
          <h1>Grandchild</h1>
          <h3>Name: {name}</h3>
        </div>
      )}
    </Context.Consumer>
  );
}
```

## 12. Redux Thunk
### Day 12: March 11, 2019 - Monday

**Project:** [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

**Live Demo:** [Async Redux Todo Goals App](https://codesandbox.io/s/0pkwq6o26l?fontsize=14) on CodeSandbox

**Progress:** Continued Udacity Redux lesson for my React Nanodegree Program.

This lesson covered the use of redux-thunk  middleware which allows us to run business logic and/or asynchronous code from our action creators.

This provides the following benefits:

- Cleaner separation between UI logic & data fetching logic.
- Ability to run async code, dispatch other actions, or update the action object prior to submitting the action to the reducer.

Redux middleware sits between the dispatch of an action and the running of the reducer. redux-thunk inspects what is returned from the action creator and passes it to reducer if it is an object. If it's a function then it invokes the function before finally passing the final object to the reducer.

## 11. Redux Optimistic Updates
### Day 11: March 10, 2019 - Sunday

**Project:** [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

[![Redux](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rr43-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rr43.jpg)<br>
**Live Demo:** [Async Redux Todo Goals App](https://codesandbox.io/s/0pkwq6o26l?fontsize=14) on CodeSandbox

**Progress:** Continued Udacity Redux lesson for my React Nanodegree Program.

This lesson covered using both optimistic and pessimistic updates to the database.

- An optimistic update modifies the Redux store prior to getting a successful confirmation back from the database.
- Pessimistic updates will only update the Redux store upon the return of a successful async request.

The reason to use optimistic updates is to provide a better UX. This updates the UI immediately when a user initiates an action rather than waiting until a response is returned.

**Progress:** Continued Udacity Redux lesson for my React Nanodegree Program.

Today I went through the last part of a tutorial called

- *[React Redux Tutorial for Beginners: The Definitive Guide (2019)](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/redux/)*

This focused on introducing redux-thunk middleware which allows asynchronous operations to work with Redux. Some of the specifics around redux-thunk are:

- Normally action creators are limited to returning an object.
- Redux Thunk is middleware that allows action creators to return a function.
- Promise-based asynchronous operations can be conducted in the action creator.
- Actions can be dispatched from the action creator as well.

Here's a sample of async code used  in the action creator.

**Live Demo:** [React Redux Middleware](https://codesandbox.io/s/0oj8rqmo70?fontsize=14) on CodeSandbox

**Progress:** Continued Udacity Redux lesson for my React Nanodegree Program.

Today I went through the third part of a tutorial called

- *[React Redux Tutorial for Beginners: The Definitive Guide (2019)](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/redux/)*

This focused on introducing Redux middleware in order to provide logic to our dispatched actions. It provides the following benefits.

- the logic can live outside React (or any other library/framework)
- middlewares become reusable pieces of logic, easily to reason about
- middlewares can be tested in isolation
- we keep the components clean

In this example I intercept an ADD_ARTICLE action after dispatch and check for the presence of unwanted words.

[![Redux](assets/images/day6c-small.jpg)](assets/images/day6c.jpg)

If a forbidden word (such as 'money') was found then the FOUND_BAD_WORD action was dispatched instead. It was then handled by our reducer.

Testing out the logic filters out entries with unwanted words.

[![Redux](assets/images/day6b-small.jpg)](assets/images/day6b.jpg)

Our state is displayed using Redux DevTools.

**Project:** [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

[![Redux](assets/images/day5-small.jpg)](assets/images/day5.jpg)<br>
**Live Demo:** [React Redux](https://codesandbox.io/s/v3ykn3oo5?fontsize=14) on CodeSandbox

**Progress:** Continued Udacity Redux lesson for my React Nanodegree Program.

Today I went through the second part of a tutorial called

- *[React Redux Tutorial for Beginners: The Definitive Guide (2019)](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/redux/)*

[![Redux](assets/images/day5a-small.jpg)](assets/images/day5a.jpg)

This focused on combining Redux & React with the react-redux package and doing the following:

- Wrapping the app with a `<Provider>` HOC (Higher Order Component)
- Calling `connect()` on any components we want to connect to Redux
- Using `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps` to allow us to access state and dispatch from a React component's props.  

This was put into practice by creating an App, List, and Form component.

- App -  parent component containing List and Form. App is wrapped with `<Provider>` to allow React to access Redux store.
- List - used `mapStateToProps` to display titles from Redux store (state).
- Form - used `mapDispatchToProps` to dispatch ADD_ARTICLE action and update the store.

## 3. Create Log Template Repo
### Day 3: March 1, 2019 - Friday

**Project:** 100 Days of Code Log  Template

[![new code log](assets/images/day3-small.jpg)](assets/images/day3.jpg)

**Progress:** Created a new GitHub repo for my 100 Days of Code Log Template project.

I quickly realized that I needed to create a separate master template repo from the one I had my current log in.

Separating the template from the log allows me to update my log without in affecting the template and update the template with affecting the log. This way anyone following changes on the template won't be notified on every log commit I make.

Additionally, any changes to the template or template instructions can the be pulled down without overwriting my log entires.
