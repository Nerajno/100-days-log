**Progress:** Continued Udacity Redux lesson for my React Nanodegree Program.

I spent the day reading through a handful of key articles that detailed how to best organize and manage code related to large-scale Redux applications.

This was very eye opening. It included the following topics.

- Normalizing data before use
- Storing data with an index and accessing it with selectors
- Keeping canonical data (data from the DB or API) separate from UI state data
- Splitting the store into sub-stores & using slice reducers
- Other best practices for connecting React components to Redux state

**Live Demo:** [React Redux Todo Goals App](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/james-priest/reactnd-redux-todos-goals-cra) on CodeSandbox

**Progress:** Continued Udacity Redux lesson for my React Nanodegree Program.

This lesson was showed how to organize and structure a React Redux app using the [Rails-style pattern](https://redux.js.org/faq/code-structure) folder structure.

This splits files according to function with these folders.

- actions
- constants
- reducers
- containers
- components

The exercise involved splitting all existing code for my Todo & Goals app according to this structure.

**Progress:** Continued Udacity Redux lesson for my React Nanodegree Program.

This lesson was about implementing the `react-redux` library to provide an efficient way to pass a Redux store to our React components.

This included

- Importing the `react-redux` library
- Wrapping `App` with Provider and passing in the store
- Using `connect()` to map state & dispatch to props and then passing in the component we want to connect the redux store to.

## 13. React Context API
### Day 13: March 13, 2019 - Wednesday

**Project:** [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

[![Redux](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rr48-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rr48.jpg)<br>
**Live Demo:** [Context API Todo Goals App](https://codesandbox.io/s/l5m5n58rx7?fontsize=14) on CodeSandbox

**Progress:** Continued Udacity Redux lesson for my React Nanodegree Program.

This lesson covered the use of React's Context API which gives deeply nested components access to props without having to pass them all the way down the hierarchy.

It uses:

- Declarative syntax
- `<Context.Provider>` to accept data which is to be passed to a consumer component
- `<Context.Consumer>` which accepts a child function that provides access to the data and returns JSX.

```jsx
// Provider
class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
  const name = 'Tyler';

  return (
    <Context.Provider value={name}>
      <Parent />
    </Context.Provider>
    );
  }
}

// Consumer
function Grandchild ({ name }) {
  return (
    <Context.Consumer>
      {(name) => (
        <div>
          <h1>Grandchild</h1>
          <h3>Name: {name}</h3>
        </div>
      )}
    </Context.Consumer>
  );
}
```

## 12. Redux Thunk
### Day 12: March 11, 2019 - Monday

**Project:** [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

[![Redux](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rr45-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rr45.jpg)<br>
**Live Demo:** [Async Redux Todo Goals App](https://codesandbox.io/s/0pkwq6o26l?fontsize=14) on CodeSandbox

**Progress:** Continued Udacity Redux lesson for my React Nanodegree Program.

This lesson covered the use of redux-thunk  middleware which allows us to run business logic and/or asynchronous code from our action creators.

This provides the following benefits:

- Cleaner separation between UI logic & data fetching logic.
- Ability to run async code, dispatch other actions, or update the action object prior to submitting the action to the reducer.

Redux middleware sits between the dispatch of an action and the running of the reducer. redux-thunk inspects what is returned from the action creator and passes it to reducer if it is an object. If it's a function then it invokes the function before finally passing the final object to the reducer.

## 11. Redux Optimistic Updates
### Day 11: March 10, 2019 - Sunday

**Project:** [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019)

[![Redux](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rr43-small.jpg)](https://james-priest.github.io/udacity-nanodegree-react/assets/images/rr43.jpg)<br>
**Live Demo:** [Async Redux Todo Goals App](https://codesandbox.io/s/0pkwq6o26l?fontsize=14) on CodeSandbox

**Progress:** Continued Udacity Redux lesson for my React Nanodegree Program.

This lesson covered using both optimistic and pessimistic updates to the database.

- An optimistic update modifies the Redux store prior to getting a successful confirmation back from the database.
- Pessimistic updates will only update the Redux store upon the return of a successful async request.

The reason to use optimistic updates is to provide a better UX. This updates the UI immediately when a user initiates an action rather than waiting until a response is returned.

**Progress:** Continued Udacity Redux lesson for my React Nanodegree Program.

This lesson focused Redux Middleware. Middleware intercepts a dispatched action before it reaches the reducer.

You can do things like:

- Extend Redux with custom functionality
- Validate, filter, or manipulate the data prior to it being reduced into state
- Middleware can be daisy-chained to run multiple extensions on the actions.

**Progress:** Continued Udacity Redux lesson for my React Nanodegree Program.

Today I went through the last part of a tutorial called

- *[React Redux Tutorial for Beginners: The Definitive Guide (2019)](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/redux/)*

This focused on introducing redux-thunk middleware which allows asynchronous operations to work with Redux. Some of the specifics around redux-thunk are:

- Normally action creators are limited to returning an object.
- Redux Thunk is middleware that allows action creators to return a function.
- Promise-based asynchronous operations can be conducted in the action creator.
- Actions can be dispatched from the action creator as well.

Here's a sample of async code used  in the action creator.

**Progress:** Continued Udacity Redux lesson for my React Nanodegree Program.

Today I went through the third part of a tutorial called

- *[React Redux Tutorial for Beginners: The Definitive Guide (2019)](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/redux/)*

This focused on introducing Redux middleware in order to provide logic to our dispatched actions. It provides the following benefits.

- the logic can live outside React (or any other library/framework)
- middlewares become reusable pieces of logic, easily to reason about
- middlewares can be tested in isolation
- we keep the components clean

In this example I intercept an ADD_ARTICLE action after dispatch and check for the presence of unwanted words.

[![Redux](assets/images/day6c-small.jpg)](assets/images/day6c.jpg)

If a forbidden word (such as 'money') was found then the FOUND_BAD_WORD action was dispatched instead. It was then handled by our reducer.

Testing out the logic filters out entries with unwanted words.

Our state is displayed using Redux DevTools.

- *[React Redux Tutorial for Beginners: The Definitive Guide (2019)](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/redux/)*

[![Redux](assets/images/day5a-small.jpg)](assets/images/day5a.jpg)

This focused on combining Redux & React with the react-redux package and doing the following:

- Wrapping the app with a `<Provider>` HOC (Higher Order Component)
- Calling `connect()` on any components we want to connect to Redux
- Using `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps` to allow us to access state and dispatch from a React component's props.  

This was put into practice by creating an App, List, and Form component.

- App -  parent component containing List and Form. App is wrapped with `<Provider>` to allow React to access Redux store.
- List - used `mapStateToProps` to display titles from Redux store (state).
- Form - used `mapDispatchToProps` to dispatch ADD_ARTICLE action and update the store.

Today I went through the first part of a tutorial called

- *[React Redux Tutorial for Beginners: The Definitive Guide (2019)](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/redux/)*

This first half focused on the basic elements of Redux and using it in console.

- The store
- Getting state
- Subscribing to state changes
- Dispatching actions

## 3. Create Log Template Repo
### Day 3: March 1, 2019 - Friday

**Project:** 100 Days of Code Log  Template

[![new code log](assets/images/day3-small.jpg)](assets/images/day3.jpg)

**Progress:** Created a new GitHub repo for my 100 Days of Code Log Template project.

I quickly realized that I needed to create a separate master template repo from the one I had my current log in.

Separating the template from the log allows me to update my log without in affecting the template and update the template with affecting the log. This way anyone following changes on the template won't be notified on every log commit I make.

Additionally, any changes to the template or template instructions can the be pulled down without overwriting my log entires.
